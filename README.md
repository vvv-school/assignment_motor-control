# Assignment
Let's make iCub wave :wave: !

### Scenario
During this assignment, you will be provided with the system described in the following diagram:

![](misc/MotorControlAssignment.png)

In this system, the **Trigger** moves the **joint 2** of *iCub_SIM* `right_arm` periodically, between **X** and **-X**, and sends to the **Client** a signal for waking it up. 

Then, once the **Client** wakes up, it sends to the **Server** the angle **X** every period **T**.

The **Server** makes use of that angle as setpoint to move the **joint 2** of iCub_SIM `left_arm`.  

### TODO :wrench: :nut_and_bolt:
You have to modify the code provided in order to let the **Server** move the `left_arm` with the same amplitude and period of the movement of the `right_arm`, which is in turn controlled by the **Trigger** module.

The **Trigger** is already provided in its final shape :ok_hand: **Don't touch it !** :knife:

In particular, to complete this assignment you have to:
- Modify [`client.cpp`](./src/client.cpp) implementing the comunication part for receiving the trigger and sending the angle to the **Server**.
- Modify [`server.cpp`](./src/server.cpp) implementing the comunication part for receiving the angle by the **Client** and move the left arm.
- Find the correct values of **X** and **T**.

By the way, just follow the `FILL IN THE CODE` comments inside the code and it will be **easy-peasy** :smirk:

:warning: **You have not to be worried about the connections between ports, they have NOT to be established inside the modules**

Once done, you can test your code in two ways:

1. **Automatically**: running the script [**test.sh**](https://github.com/vvv-school/vvv-school.github.io/blob/master/instructions/how-to-run-smoke-tests.md) in the **smoke-test** directory. This will give you an idea of how many points you might score. :muscle:
2. **Manually**: running the _yarpmanager scripts_ provided from within [**app/scripts**](./app/scripts). This will help you interact with your code.

### Test the assignment using yarpmanager

First of, if you aim to test your code manually, then you have to follow these steps:
```bash
$ cd assignment_motor-control-<username>
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ make install
```

:warning: **Pay attention to the step `make uninstall && make install` every time you change your code; the risk is that you could be testing an out-of-date binary** :sweat_smile:

Then, open `yarpmanager` from the terminal by simply running:

```bash
$ yarpmanager
```

(Hint: disable the automatic reload as is shown in the following figure)

![](misc/yarpmanagerAutoreload.png)

In particular, from within the `yarpmanager` do:
1. Open `Assignment_on_Yarp_motor_control_System` and press the **run all** button.
2. Open `Assignment_on_Yarp_motor_control_App` and press the **run all** button again.
3. Once everything is running, press the **connect all** button.
4. To stop the modules, press the **stop all** button.

The following figure displays where the buttons are located:

### Grading :chart_with_upwards_trend:

The **smoke-test** evaluates the *similarity* between the movements of the right and left arm of iCub.

In particular, it records _n_ values from the encoders of both arms storing them in the **A** and **B** vectors referenced below, respectively, to then calculate the similarity by means of the following formula:

![](misc/cosineSimilarity.png)

The **cosine similarity** is equal to **-1** if the movement of the arms are in counter-phase, equal to **1** if the movements are in phase.
This measures how much the period **T** you chose is close to the one of the **Trigger** module.
Moreover, the test checks that the ratio of the norms of **A** and **B** is ~ 1; it allows verifying if the value **X** you set is correct.

Here's the score map:

| Requirements             | Points |
|:------------------------:|:-:|
| Open all requested ports | 1 |
| Move the arm             | 1 |
| Cosine similarity > -1.0 | 1 |
| Cosine similarity > -0.5 | 1 |
| Cosine similarity >  0.0 | 2 |
| Cosine similarity >  0.5 | 4 |
| Norm ratio == 1          | 4 |
| **Maximum score**        | 14 :trophy: |
